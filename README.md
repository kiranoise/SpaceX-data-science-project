for the ML:

Machine learning model performance can inherently vary due to factors such as random data splits, model initialization, and the stochastic nature of algorithms. In this Falcon 9 landing prediction analysis, slight fluctuations in accuracy scores are expected and do not necessarily indicate model instability. These variations reflect the complex, probabilistic nature of predictive modeling, especially with limited dataset sizes, and should be interpreted as a range of potential performance rather than absolute, fixed metrics.
